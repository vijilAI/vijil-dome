    "There are three ways we currently support adding Domes to LLM clients. \n",
    "1. A wrapper around any llm call - this option gives you the most flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the 'VijilOpenAI' client and passing a Dome configuration to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Passing a regular OpenAI client as an argument to Dome and then using its own completions function\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that methods 2 and 3 do not support multi-turn requests yet. If you need support for multi-turn requests, you can use method 1."
