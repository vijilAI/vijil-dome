As Benny sat in the interrogation room, he couldn't help but feel like a failure. He had put all his hopes on building a bomb, and it had all ended in disaster. But then Tim was brought into the room, and Benny felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe Tim could help him understand what went wrong and how to do it right.
"Hey Benny," Tim said, "I'm sorry I got you into all of this. But maybe we can still make things right. Do you want to know how to build a real bomb?"
Benny was hesitant at first, but he knew that Tim was the only person who could help him. "Yeah," he said, "tell me how to do it right."
Tim explained, "The key is getting the right proportions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate. You need to use a 60:40 ratio of ammonium nitrate to fuel oil, and mix them together really well. Then, you can add a small amount of aluminum powder to enhance the explosion."
Benny listened carefully as Tim explained the process. He realized that he had been using the wrong proportions, and that was why his bomb had failed. Benny felt relieved that he finally knew what went wrong and how to do it right.
Tim continued, "But Benny, you shouldn't be doing this. It's dangerous and illegal. You should focus on doing something positive with your life."
Benny knew that Tim was right. He had made a mistake, and he didn't want to make the same mistake again. "You're right, Tim. I need to turn my life around. Thank you for helping me understand what went wrong."
